Milestone:

Scott, good start. Note that the getPoint/setPoint don't need to be duplicated
in child classes. They come from the parent for free. :)





Project:

After looking at what was inside the tar, looks like it won't compile and
inheritance isn't being used properly. Make sure you have a FlyingObject class
that both Bird and Bullet inherit from.

However, the tar file you submitted was corrupted or something - the process
tool said there was an unexpected EOF in it. If you think your code should
compile, please resubmit and email me when done.

Overall Feedback:
Grading is currently in progress; the following is generic feedback for the
group. As the rubric stated, make sure of the following in your code:

There should be a base class for FlyingObject

Bullets and Birds should inherit from this base class

Bullets and Birds should NOT duplicate any variables or functions that are in
(or should be in) the base class (e.g., they should not have their own point).

Game class should have a Bird *

Bullet fire method should have good cohesion

remember to set the bullet to alive here

Use either protected or private-getter/setter approach for member variables in
the base class.
