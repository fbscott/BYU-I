OK. I think I have it:

Alex == "Knight"
Brook == "Spy"
Cody == "Knave"

The logic is as follows:

Brook says Alex is the knight. Since there can only be one knight and the knight
cannot lie, that means Brook is not the knight. No knight would say that someone
else is the knight.

Cody says he's the spy. This means that Cody is also not the knight. A knight
would not lie and say he is anything other than a knight.

That leaves Alex as the knight.

Now that we know Alex is the knight, we can trust when he says that Cody is the
knave.

That leaves Brook as the spy.

My booleans:

Alex == true; // knight
Brook == true || false; // spy
Cody == false; // knave
